1
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,661
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,708
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,438
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,608
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,487
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,477
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,645
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,357
Uh...

9
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,612
Marge. How lovely to see-

10
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,450
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,951
What is it?

12
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,245
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,081
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,459
I will if she does.

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,754
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,799
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,926
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,471
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,976
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,937
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,397
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,525
Okay.

23
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,781
 Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,743
 Can l tempt you, Marge?
Just a small one.

25
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,913
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,499
A bit more.

27
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,336
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,130
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,219
Ah! You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,431
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,726
What are you smirking at?

32
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,728
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,232
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution
for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,402
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,198
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,076
Yeah. l've been beaten loads of times.

37
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,829
 Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,165
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,460
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,548
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,884
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,053
PETUNlA: Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,056
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,767
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,858
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,860
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,280
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,659
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,622
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,834
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,711
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,762
Right. Let me tell you...

53
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,110
Oh...

54
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,327
Vernon!

55
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,165
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,879
Ow! Ripper! Ow...

57
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,627
Stop!

58
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,757
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

59
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,179
 Hold on, hold on.
Get off.

60
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,266
- Don't you dare!
Sorry.

61
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,310
Oh, Vernon.

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,229
Oh, God.

63
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,189
Marge!

64
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,449
Please!

65
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,285
Marge!

66
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,539
Come back!

67
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,940
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

68
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,526
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

69
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,736
VERNON SCREAMS]

70
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,947
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

71
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,159
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

72
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,660
You've nowhere to go.

73
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,163
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

74
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,136
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

75
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,681
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

76
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,811
My name is Stan Shunpike, and l will be
your conductor for this evening."

77
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,983
What you doing down there?

78
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,903
- l fell over.
- What you fall over for?

79
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,780
- l didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

80
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,158
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

81
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,335
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

82
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,253
Well, come on, then. ln.

83
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,590
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

84
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,430
Come on.

85
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,068
Come on. Move on, move on.

86
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,086
 Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

87
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,505
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

88
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,477
- What did you say your name was?
- l didn't.

89
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,148
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

90
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,277
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

91
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,779
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

92
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,156
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

93
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,788
 The Muggles. Can't they see us?
Muggles?

94
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,707
They don't see nothing, do they?

95
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
If you jab them with a fork, they feel.

96
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,214
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

97
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,517
Ten, nine, eight...

98
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,437
...seven, six, five...

99
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,897
...four, three, three and a half...

100
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,899
...two, one and three quarters.

101
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,068
Yes!

102
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,992
Who is that? That man.

103
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,830
Who is that?

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,540
Who is-?

105
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,126
That is Sirius Black, that is.

106
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,963
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

107
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,550
He's a murderer.

108
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,345
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

109
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,432
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

110
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,559
He's the first one that done it.

111
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,146
He was a big supporter of...

112
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,148
...You-Know-Who.

113
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,734
I reckon you've heard of him.

114
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,486
Yeah.

115
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,987
Him I've heard of.

116
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,326
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

117
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,495
They're getting closer, Ernie.

118
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,539
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

119
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,007
Mind your head.

120
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,808
Hey, guys? Guys?
Why the long faces?

121
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,817
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,657
The Leaky Cauldron.

123
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,659
Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

124
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,663
Ah. Mr. Potter, at last.

125
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,377
 Take it away, Ern.
Take it away!

126
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,402
Room 11.

127
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,322
Hedwig.

128
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,325
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

129
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,829
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

130
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,751
 As Minister for Magic,
it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...

131
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,130
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

132
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,259
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

133
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,180
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

134
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:31,143
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

135
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:36,023
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

136
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,775
So that's that...

137
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,069
...and no harm done.

138
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,822
Pea soup?

139
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,116
No, thank you.

140
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,494
- Minister?
- Yes?

141
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,412
- l don't understand.
- Understand?

142
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,166
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

143
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,377
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

144
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,087
...for blowing up their aunts.

145
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,597
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

146
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,225
...was very, very irresponsible.

147
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:15,229
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

148
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,231
Sirius Black, you mean?

149
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,149
But what's he got to do with me?

150
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:26,281
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

151
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,618
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

152
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,746
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

153
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,917
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

154
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,048
Hedwig.

155
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:48,303
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

156
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,597
...wander.

157
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,519
 Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

158
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,350
WlTCH MAID:
Housekeeping.

159
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,022
I'll come back later.

160
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,031
I'm warning you, Hermione.

161
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,910
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or l'll turn it into a tea cozy.

162
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,245
HERMlONE: lt's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

163
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,332
- lt's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

164
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,043
- Looks like a pig with hair.
HERMlONE: That's rich...

165
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,754
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

166
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,340
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

167
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,636
Harry.

168
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,890
 Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,435
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,814
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,150
 Not flashing that clipping again?
- l haven't shown anyone.

172
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,736
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,405
 The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,615
 Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,450
- Harry.
Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,536
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,037
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,373
- Yes? All your books?
- lt's all upstairs.

179
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,958
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,167
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,586
- Harry Potter.
Mr. Weasley.

182
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,257
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,093
 Hermione.
HERMlONE: Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,888
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,812
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,648
...from divulging what l'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,152
But l think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,904
You are in danger.

189
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,032
Grave danger.

190
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,161
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,372
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,251
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,755
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,757
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,258
Sorry.

196
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,344
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,138
...Black lost everything.

198
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,601
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,936
And in his mind...

200
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,106
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,027
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,362
And that is why...

203
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,073
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,117
To find you.

205
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,204
And kill me.

206
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,832
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,543
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,253
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:54,424
...why would l go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,843
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,970
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,765
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,434
Don't lose him!

214
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,562
I didn't mean to blow her up. l just-

215
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,190
- l lost control.
Brilliant.

216
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,944
HERMlONE: Honestly, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,862
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,073
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,992
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,205
Who do you think that is?

221
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,250
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
Do you know everything?

222
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,544
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,839
- lt's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,425
 Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,263
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,821
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,823
- ...to come after you?
Yeah.

228
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,992
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,870
- l mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,373
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,002
- ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,630
HERMlONE:
Why are we stopping?

233
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,425
We can't be there yet.

234
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,890
What's going on?

235
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,767
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,022
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,816
There's something moving out there.

238
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,458
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,527
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,226
HERMlONE:
Harry.

241
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,146
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,987
Thank you.

243
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,615
LUPlN:
Here, eat this. lt'll help.

244
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,243
It's all right. lt's chocolate.

245
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,626
What was that thing that came?

246
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,213
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. lt's gone now.

247
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,091
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,887
If you'll excuse me, l need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,394
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,526
What happened to me?

251
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,445
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,782
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,327
And did either of you two...

254
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,828
...you know...

255
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,082
- ...pass out?
- No.

256
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,958
I felt weird, though.

257
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,960
Like l'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,422
But someone was screaming.

259
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,965
A woman.

260
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,718
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,865
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,117
Now, l'd like to say a few words...

263
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:58,621
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,041
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,669
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,338
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,049
Good luck, professor.

268
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,473
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,810
Potter. Potter. ls it true you fainted?

270
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,647
- l mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,816
 How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,360
 Our Care of
Magical Creatures teacher...

273
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,446
...has decided to retire...

274
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,366
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,286
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,289
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,793
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,849
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,560
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,941
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,486
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,699
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,534
Now whilst l've been assured...

284
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,372
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,873
...a word of caution.

286
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,252
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,838
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,634
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,429
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:44,310
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,732
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,528
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,616
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,630
Fortuna Major.

295
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,136
 Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,264
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

297
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,266
Watch this.

298
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:38,990
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

299
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,744
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,748
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,083
- She can't even sing.
Exactly.

302
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,919
 Hey, man.
Hey, man.

303
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,881
 Oh, God.
HERMlONE: That's awful.

304
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,633
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,472
 What is that?
You call that a monkey?

306
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,849
Do not give him one again.

307
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,643
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,486
 Ron, catch.
l will.

309
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,785
I think we have a winner.

310
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,080
- Oh, don't try one of them.
Oh, no.

311
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,208
Look at him. His face.

312
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,087
Welcome, my children.

313
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:21,384
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:26,848
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,228
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:37,024
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:41,070
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,824
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,701
What do you see?

320
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:52,540
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,168
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,881
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,966
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,802
- l've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,263
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,390
I think so.

327
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,351
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,731
Pity.

329
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,567
Broaden your minds.

330
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,491
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,576
- l think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,995
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,456
Yeah. Um, well...

334
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:38,127
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,215
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,758
So...

337
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,970
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,514
Give me the cup.

339
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,976
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,730
My dear...

341
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,485
...you have the Grim.

342
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,071
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,115
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,451
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,120
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,331
It's an omen...

347
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,333
...of death."

348
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,675
 You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,804
HERMlONE: Honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,641
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,936
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,771
HERMlONE:
A fair few.

353
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,023
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,985
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,153
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,699
HERMlONE: Don't be silly. How could
anyone be in two classes at once?

357
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,911
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

358
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,250
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,252
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,421
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,768
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,438
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,231
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,319
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,498
 Don't be such a wimp.
- l'm okay. Okay.

366
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,380
- l think they're funny.
Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,050
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,511
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,222
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,018
Ooh...

371
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,281
Dementor! Dementor!

372
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,875
HERMlONE: Just ignore him.
You're supposed to stroke it.

373
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,502
Yeah.

374
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,507
Tah-tah-dah-dah!

375
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,723
Isn't he beautiful?

376
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,518
Say hello to Buckbeak.

377
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,354
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

378
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,606
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

379
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,276
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

380
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:53,364
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

381
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,283
It may be the last thing you ever do.

382
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,829
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

383
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,458
Well done, Harry. Well done.

384
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,629
Come on now.

385
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,506
Now...

386
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,427
...you have to let him make the first
move. lt's only polite. So...

387
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,470
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

388
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,098
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

389
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,392
If he does, you can go and touch him.

390
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,770
If not- Well,
we'll get to that later.

391
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,483
Just make your bow.

392
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,737
Nice and low.

393
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,744
Back off, Harry. Back off.

394
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:46,792
Keep still.

395
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:59,388
Oh, well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

396
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,435
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

397
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,479
Go on. Don't be shy.

398
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,942
Ow!

399
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,364
 Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

400
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,119
Not so fast, Harry.

401
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,461
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

402
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,839
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

403
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,052
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

404
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,054
That's it...

405
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,014
Yes!

406
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,018
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

407
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,187
Does he get to fly?

408
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,773
 He may let you ride him now.
- What?

409
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,108
- Come on.
Hey, hey, hey!

410
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,861
 Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

411
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,908
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

412
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,416
Whoa!

413
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,473
Ha! Whoo-hoo!

414
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,346
 Well done, Harry,
and well done, Buckbeak.

415
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,473
HERMlONE:
That was wicked, Harry!

416
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,058
Oh, please.

417
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,186
Well done, well done.

418
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,065
- How am l doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

419
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,697
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

420
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,949
Malfoy, no...

421
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,202
 No!
- Ow!

422
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,995
Buckbeak!

423
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,331
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

424
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,292
Whoa! Buckbeak!

425
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,754
Away, you silly creature...

426
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,049
- lt's killed me! lt's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

427
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,467
Hagrid!

428
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,680
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- l'm the teacher. l'll do it.

429
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,770
 You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

430
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,231
You and your bloody chicken!

431
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,756
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

432
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,802
 lt comes and it goes.
Still, l consider myself lucky.

433
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,305
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and l could've lost my arm.

434
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,517
- l can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

435
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,022
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

436
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,942
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

437
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,986
 He's been sighted!
Who?

438
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,904
Sirius Black!

439
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,950
HERMlONE:
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

440
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,995
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

441
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,664
 With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

442
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,168
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

443
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,922
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

444
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,885
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

445
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,080
LUPlN:
Intriguing, isn't it?

446
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,086
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

447
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,046
...as to what is inside?

448
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,633
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

449
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,929
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

450
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,181
HERMlONE: No one knows.
- When did she get here?

451
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,891
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

452
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,311
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

453
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:43,941
- That's what makes them so-
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

454
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:49,613
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

455
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,743
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

456
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,538
After me. Riddikulus!

457
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,873
 Riddikulus!
LUPlN: Very good.

458
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,584
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

459
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,003
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

460
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,297
- This class is ridiculous.
LUPlN: Very good.

461
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:11,510
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

462
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,430
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

463
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,060
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

464
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,356
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

465
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,900
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

466
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,570
Come on.

467
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,532
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

468
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,409
Professor Snape.

469
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,452
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

470
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,039
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

471
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:45,711
- You live with your grandmother.
- l don't want it to turn into her, either.

472
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,796
No...

473
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,425
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

474
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,887
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

475
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,182
- She carries a red handbag-
- We don't need to hear.

476
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,227
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when l open that wardrobe...

477
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,731
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

478
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,109
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

479
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,028
Can you do that?

480
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,323
Yes. Wand at the ready.

481
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,160
One, two, three.

482
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,838
Think, Neville, think.

483
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,635
Riddikulus!

484
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,850
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

485
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,978
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

486
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,527
Form a line!

487
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,114
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

488
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,409
...and turn it into something funny.

489
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,328
Next! Ron!

490
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,085
LUPlN: Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

491
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,098
Wand at the ready, Ron.

492
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,891
Riddikulus!

493
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,689
Yes! You see? Very good, very good!

494
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,028
Marvelous! Absolutely, very,
very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

495
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,032
Show us what you see.

496
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,712
LUPlN:
Keep your nerve. Steady.

497
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,839
Riddikulus!

498
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,842
And next! Step up, step up!

499
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,761
Wonderful, wonderful!

500
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,902
Here!

501
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,577
Riddikulus!

502
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,005
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

503
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,174
Collect your books from the back.

504
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,968
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

505
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,180
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

506
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,770
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

507
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,898
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

508
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,984
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

509
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,738
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

510
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,448
That's the rule, Potter.

511
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,868
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

512
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,537
I thought if you signed it,
then l could-

513
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,207
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

514
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,585
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

515
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,467
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

516
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,930
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

517
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,779
Professor, can l ask you something?

518
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,825
LUPlN: You want to know why l stopped
you facing that boggart, yes?

519
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,451
I thought it'd be obvious.

520
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,454
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

521
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:53,125
I did think of Voldemort at first.

522
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,961
But then l remembered that night
on the train...

523
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,672
- ...and the dementor.
- l'm very impressed.

524
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,716
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

525
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,385
This is very wise.

526
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,637
Before I fainted...

527
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,889
...l heard something.

528
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,058
A woman...

529
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,852
...screaming.

530
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,313
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

531
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,442
Our pain becomes their power.

532
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,486
I think it was my mother...

533
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,864
...the night she was murdered.

534
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,953
The very first time l saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

535
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,373
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

536
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,959
They're your mother, Lily's.

537
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,336
Yes.

538
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,673
Oh, yes. I knew her.

539
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,846
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

540
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,266
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

541
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,769
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

542
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,356
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

543
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:04,696
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

544
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,867
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

545
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,577
...he...

546
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,414
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

547
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:22,214
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

548
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,179
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

549
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,141
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

550
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,982
 Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

551
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,735
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

552
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,948
- You heard it's the most-
Haunted building in Britain.

553
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,825
What's going on?

554
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,453
 Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

555
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,039
- Hey.
Oh, you're there.

556
00:47:56,207 --> 00:48:00,502
 Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

557
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,797
Get back, all of you.

558
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:07,133
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

559
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,635
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

560
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,181
 Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

561
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,683
HERMlONE:
It's not funny, Ron.

562
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,271
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.

563
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,356
Back to your common room.

564
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:30,907
 Be quiet. The headmaster's here.
Come on, move.

565
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,993
You heard. Move!

566
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,093
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

567
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:54,514
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

568
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,809
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

569
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,936
The Fat Lady's there.

570
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,607
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

571
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,860
You listen! l'm Head Boy!

572
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,446
- Come back here!
Keep moving!

573
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,910
Dear lady, who did this to you?

574
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:22,876
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

575
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,796
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

576
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,592
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!

577
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:37,182
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

578
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:10,173
 l searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

579
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,926
 Thank you.
WlZARD TEACHER: The floor's clear.

580
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,261
 Good.
I've done the dungeons.

581
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,889
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

582
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,600
I didn't really expect him to linger.

583
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,187
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

584
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,648
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

585
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,484
- ...completely undetected?
Quite remarkable.

586
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,528
Any theories on how he managed it?

587
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,698
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

588
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,491
You may recall...

589
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,494
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

590
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,746
...about your appointment
of Professor-

591
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:46,000
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

592
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,586
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

593
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,382
...and l'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

594
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,884
 What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

595
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,721
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

596
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:03,309
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

597
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:10,108
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

598
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,774
Turn to page 394.

599
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,787
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

600
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:07,916
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

601
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,961
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

602
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:17,217
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

603
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,723
"Werewolves"?

604
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,810
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

605
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,188
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

606
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,566
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

607
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,695
 Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

608
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,323
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

609
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,951
No one?

610
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,371
- How disappointing.
HERMlONE: Please, sir.

611
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,749
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

612
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,459
A werewolf has no choice.

613
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,586
With each full moon...

614
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:57,632
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

615
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,718
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

616
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,348
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

617
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,851
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

618
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,019
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

619
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,523
...or do you take pride in being
an insufferable know-it-all?

620
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,235
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

621
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,031
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

622
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,952
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

623
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,705
- ...on recognizing it.
- lt's Quidditch tomorrow.

624
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,126
Then l suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

625
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,380
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

626
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,342
Page 394.

627
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,804
The term "werewolf"...

628
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:50,226
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

629
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:55,398
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

630
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,401
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

631
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,613
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

632
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,781
...being bitten by a werewolf...

633
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,220
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

634
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,843
Aresto momentum!

635
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,223
 He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
Peaky?

636
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,684
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

637
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,729
 Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

638
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,982
 Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

639
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,614
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

640
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,783
You gave us a right good scare.

641
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:55,536
 What happened?
Well, you fell off your broom.

642
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,164
Really? l meant the match. Who won?

643
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,295
Um, no one blames you, Harry.

644
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:08,341
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

645
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,635
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

646
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,472
There's something else
you should know too.

647
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:21,354
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

648
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,356
Well...

649
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,692
LUPlN: I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

650
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,862
Is there no chance of fixing it?

651
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,405
No.

652
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,909
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

653
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,412
- l mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

654
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,749
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

655
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:46,212
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

656
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:51,342
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

657
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:55,763
You are not weak, Harry.

658
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:00,017
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

659
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,312
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

660
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,065
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

661
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:10,319
- l'm scared, professor.
- l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

662
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,990
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

663
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,159
You made the one
on the train go away.

664
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,119
There was only one that night.

665
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,999
- But you made it go away.
- l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

666
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:28,296
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

667
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:32,133
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

668
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,218
For now, I need to rest.

669
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:03,956
 Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

670
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,557
 Guys, let me go.
Clever, Harry.

671
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,644
 But not clever enough.
We've got a better way.

672
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,647
 l'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
We know.

673
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,940
We'll get you there.

674
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,901
 We'll show you a quicker way.
If you pipe down.

675
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,655
- Bless him.
Let me go! Come on. Don't-

676
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,866
 Now, Harry.
Come and join the big boys.

677
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,411
- What are you doing?!
Shh!

678
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,498
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

679
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,001
- lt's the secret to our success.
- lt's a wrench giving it to you-

680
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:52,088
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

681
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,006
George, if you will.

682
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,468
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

683
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,684
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

684
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,062
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

685
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,564
We owe them so much.

686
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:17,947
 Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that-

687
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,574
- No. Is that really-?
- Dumbledore.

688
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,076
- ln his study.
- Pacing.

689
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,203
Does that a lot.

690
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,579
So this map shows-

691
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,872
 Everyone.
- Everyone?

692
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,457
- Where they are.
- What they do.

693
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,750
- Every minute.
- Every day.

694
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:32,920
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

695
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,840
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

696
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:38,676
- ...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

697
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,013
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
Leads you to Honeyduke's.

698
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,015
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

699
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,601
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

700
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:52,106
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

701
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,643
Now, how much do you want?

702
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,861
Delicious.

703
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,914
HERMlONE: lt's meant to be
the most haunted building in Britain.

704
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,500
- Did l mention that?
Twice.

705
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,836
- Oh. Do you want to move a bit closer?
- Huh?

706
01:01:56,046 --> 01:02:00,925
- To the Shrieking Shack?
- Oh. Actually, I'm fine here.

707
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,927
Well, well. Look who's here.

708
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,596
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

709
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:10,101
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

710
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,521
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

711
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:17,775
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

712
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,571
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

713
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,740
You filthy little mudblood!

714
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,496
Who is that?

715
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,088
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

716
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,193
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

717
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,574
Get out of the way!

718
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,367
Move!

719
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,829
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

720
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:17,543
Harry!

721
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,755
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

722
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,177
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

723
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,805
HERMlONE: He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.

724
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,223
Aren't you?

725
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,018
Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.

726
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:36,687
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

727
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,190
- Ron fancies her.
That's not true!

728
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,233
 McGonagall!
Cornelius!

729
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,776
Allow me, minister.

730
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,820
 Oh, Hagrid...
Sorry.

731
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,948
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

732
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,036
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

733
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,248
- ...into my pub every other night!
We have...

734
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,877
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

735
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,671
And what would bring him here?

736
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,841
 Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

737
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,260
- Shh!
Come.

738
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,474
HERMlONE:
Harry!

739
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:25,653
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

740
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,696
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

741
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,366
 Thick?!
How dare they!

742
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,285
- Who are they calling that?
Whippersnappers!

743
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,748
 Nobody will come to a pub
where they'll get scared out of their wits.

744
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,085
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

745
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,423
Tell me what this is all about.

746
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:51,053
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death-

747
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,889
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

748
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,935
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

749
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,355
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

750
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,900
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

751
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,319
 Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

752
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,572
- Trailing after Black.
l remember.

753
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,740
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

754
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,660
- What happened?
He tried to warn them...

755
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:18,998
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

756
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:23,043
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

757
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,421
He destroyed him!

758
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,801
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

759
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,013
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

760
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,391
- ...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

761
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,436
 l don't believe it.
That's not the worst.

762
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:44,398
 What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

763
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,734
...and remains to this day...

764
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,819
...Harry Potter's godfather!

765
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,747
HERMlONE:
Ron, look!

766
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,047
HERMlONE: Excuse me, excuse me.
Merry Christmas.

767
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,337
Harry, what happened?

768
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,966
He was their friend...

769
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,719
...and he betrayed them.

770
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,472
He was their friend!

771
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,685
I hope he finds me.

772
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,646
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

773
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,732
When he does, l'm gonna kill him!

774
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,623
LUPlN:
Harry.

775
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,792
There you are. You came.

776
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:31,046
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

777
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,674
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

778
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,384
I'm sure.

779
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,429
Well, everything's prepared.

780
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,057
The spell l'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

781
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,726
Did you ever hear of it?

782
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,561
No? Well...

783
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,314
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

784
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:54,153
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

785
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,157
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

786
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:02,286
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

787
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,290
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

788
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,710
Close your eyes.

789
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,380
Concentrate.

790
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,717
Explore your past.

791
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,094
Do you have a memory?

792
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,890
Allow it to fill you up.

793
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,684
Lose yourself within it.

794
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:31,356
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

795
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,610
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

796
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:41,742
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

797
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,179
Expecto Patronum!

798
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,308
Expecto... Expecto...

799
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,268
Expect...

800
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,358
LUPlN: Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

801
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,445
It's all right. l didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

802
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:23,992
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

803
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,704
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

804
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,666
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

805
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:34,002
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

806
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,797
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

807
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,676
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

808
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,222
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

809
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:57,359
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

810
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,405
Well, it is.

811
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,157
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

812
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:08,287
- ...but it's complicated.
- ls it strong?

813
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,502
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

814
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,047
Just do it.

815
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:37,566
Expecto Patronum!

816
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,255
LUPlN:
Yes!

817
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,636
Well done, Harry. Well done!

818
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,307
 l think l've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

819
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,893
Eat this, it helps. lt really helps.

820
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,853
And just so you know, Harry...

821
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,731
...l think you'd have given your father
a run for his money.

822
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:21,234
And that is saying something.

823
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,405
I was thinking of him.

824
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,741
And Mum.

825
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,160
Seeing their faces.

826
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,497
They were talking to me.

827
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,916
Just talking.

828
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,418
That's the memory l chose.

829
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,506
I don't even know if it's real.

830
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,175
But it's the best I have.

831
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,728
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

832
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,897
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

833
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,483
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

834
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,820
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- l haven't lost anything!

835
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,114
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

836
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,617
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

837
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:14,705
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

838
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,749
HERMlONE: Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

839
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,002
 Your cat killed him!
HERMlONE: Did not.

840
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,670
 Did.
HERMlONE: Didn't.

841
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,341
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

842
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,803
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

843
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,639
...talking about why we were there.

844
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,185
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

845
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,313
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

846
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,567
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

847
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,945
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

848
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:50,157
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

849
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,159
HERMlONE:
And then?

850
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,579
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

851
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:59,875
 They're not sacking you!
No, l'm not sacked.

852
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,963
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

853
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:37,370
Spiders! There's- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

854
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,123
- l don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

855
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,294
Right, yeah. Tell them. l'll tell them...

856
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,815
 Peter Pettigrew?
Lump ofa boy.

857
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,901
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.

858
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,570
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

859
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,124
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

860
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,794
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

861
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,588
SLEEPlNG PORTRAlT:
Yes, we are.

862
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,307
Mischief managed. Nox.

863
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,852
Potter.

864
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,522
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

865
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,857
I was sleepwalking.

866
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,568
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

867
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:36,489
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

868
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:41,036
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

869
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,873
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it
if you could lower your wand.

870
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,253
Turn out your pockets.

871
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:54,549
Turn out your pockets!

872
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,095
What's this?

873
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,515
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

874
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:12,776
Reveal your secrets.

875
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,031
Read it.

876
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:25,997
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

877
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:30,293
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

878
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,087
Go on.

879
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,133
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

880
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,886
- You insolent little-
- Professor!

881
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,224
Well, well. Lupin.

882
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:49,104
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

883
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,899
Harry, are you all right?

884
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,568
That remains to be seen.

885
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,156
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

886
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,868
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

887
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,832
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- l seriously doubt it, Severus.

888
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,502
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

889
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,548
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

890
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:20,969
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

891
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,264
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

892
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:27,767
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

893
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,526
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

894
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,074
LUPlN:
Come in.

895
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:50,081
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

896
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:54,753
...but quite frankly, l am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

897
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,590
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

898
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:00,759
...is a map to you?

899
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,054
- No.
- No, sir.

900
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:09,100
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

901
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:13,605
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

902
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:18,318
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

903
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:22,947
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

904
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,325
Now, l will not cover up for you again.

905
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,952
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

906
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,790
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

907
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:36,711
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

908
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:45,804
 Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

909
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:51,643
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone l know to be dead.

910
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,813
LUPlN:
Oh, really? And who might that be?

911
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,523
Peter Pettigrew.

912
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,236
That's not possible.

913
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,114
It's just what l saw.

914
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,660
Good night, professor.

915
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:16,334
 Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

916
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:21,339
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.

917
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,427
Only then can you see. Try again.

918
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,054
Now, what do we have here?

919
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:32,600
- Oh. Do you mind me trying?
- Ah...

920
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,981
The Grim, possibly.

921
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:44,237
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

922
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,199
...l sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

923
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:52,287
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

924
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:56,124
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

925
01:19:56,292 --> 01:20:00,295
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

926
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:03,590
...to which you so desperately cleave.

927
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,107
Have l said something?

928
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:30,783
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

929
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,536
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

930
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,872
Hang on.

931
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,958
- We better take this back.
- l'm not going back.

932
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,712
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

933
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:25,755
Harry Potter...

934
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:36,891
- Professor Trelawney-
He will return tonight.

935
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,685
Sorry?

936
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:43,523
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

937
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,733
...shall break free.

938
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,152
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

939
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:54,325
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

940
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:03,918
Oh, l'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

941
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,504
No.

942
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:08,506
Nothing.

943
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:05,146
HERMlONE: l can't believe they're going
to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

944
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,066
- lt just got worse.
What did l say? Father said...

945
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:12,403
...l can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

946
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,031
This is going to be rich.

947
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,408
 Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

948
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:20,703
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

949
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,622
Hermione, no!

950
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,458
He's not worth it.

951
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,599
- Oh!
Malfoy, are you okay?

952
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:46,020
- Let's go. Quick.
Not a word to anyone.

953
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:50,608
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

954
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:14,340
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

955
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,801
Why don't we just set him free?

956
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,387
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

957
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,557
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

958
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,101
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

959
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,146
When it happens.

960
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,647
Great man, Dumbledore.

961
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,691
A great man.

962
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,655
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

963
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,992
Think l want you seeing
something like that? No.

964
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,829
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

965
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,630
Scabbers! You're alive!

966
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:58,509
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- l think you owe someone an apology.

967
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:02,430
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

968
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,681
I meant me!

969
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,601
Blimey. What was that?

970
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,482
Ow!

971
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,484
Hagrid!

972
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,737
Oh, crikey.

973
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,949
No, minister. Over this way.

974
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,245
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

975
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:30,208
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

976
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:33,961
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

977
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,799
Quick. Quick!

978
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,717
Hagrid.

979
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:43,805
- lt'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

980
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,434
That's ling you see there-

981
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,270
- On the slope- Ah, Hagrid.
Professor Dumbledore.

982
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:54,148
 Good evening.
Make your way through.

983
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:58,194
- Have a tea, if you like.
No, Hagrid.

984
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,865
 Gentlemen.
I'd like a cup of tea.

985
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:06,410
 Well, I think we should
get down to our business, shall we?

986
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:11,165
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

987
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,502
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

988
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:20,174
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

989
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:23,886
 Dear, dear...
Hagrid. Now, come on.

990
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,555
All right. lt'll be all right.

991
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,809
 The execution shall dispatch-
What?

992
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:32,645
I thought I just saw-

993
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,939
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

994
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,154
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

995
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,328
Oh, no.

996
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,466
He bit me. Scabbers.

997
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:46,802
Ron. Ron!

998
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,514
 Ron!
Scabbers, come back.

999
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,768
Wait!

1000
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,986
 Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1001
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,447
That's not good. Ron, run!

1002
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:11,243
Harry, Hermione, run!

1003
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,330
It's the Grim!

1004
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,798
- Ah! Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1005
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,592
- Ron!
- Harry!

1006
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,554
- Help!
Ron!

1007
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,515
Ah!

1008
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:35,935
 Ron. Ron.
HERMlONE: Ron!

1009
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,785
Come on!

1010
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:56,122
Move!

1011
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,919
HERMlONE:
Duck!

1012
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,082
HERMlONE:
Harry!

1013
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,976
HERMlONE: Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1014
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:03,064
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- l have a hunch.

1015
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,107
I just hope l'm wrong.

1016
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:27,963
HERMlONE: We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1017
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,674
Come on.

1018
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:42,436
Ron.

1019
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,606
HERMlONE: Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1020
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:49,026
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1021
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,417
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1022
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,670
No. Only one will die tonight.

1023
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,797
Then it'll be you!

1024
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,180
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1025
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,225
- Expelliarmus!
Ah!

1026
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,108
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1027
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:32,361
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1028
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:36,574
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1029
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,210
- l found him.
LUPlN: I know.

1030
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:49,503
- lt's him.
- l understand.

1031
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,882
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1032
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,052
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1033
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,806
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1034
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:05,311
How long have you known?

1035
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:09,023
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
LUPlN: Well, Hermione.

1036
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,734
You are the brightest witch
of your age l've ever met.

1037
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:14,737
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1038
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,573
- Wait!
- l did my waiting!

1039
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,159
Twelve years of it!

1040
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,162
In Azkaban!

1041
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:34,381
LUPlN:
Very well. Kill him.

1042
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:38,719
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1043
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,471
I know why.

1044
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,932
You betrayed my parents.

1045
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,018
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1046
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,103
Somebody did betray your parents...

1047
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:51,774
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1048
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,444
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1049
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:58,739
And he's in this room! Right now!

1050
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:02,201
Come out, come out, Peter!

1051
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:05,371
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1052
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,834
Vengeance is sweet.

1053
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,254
How I hoped l'd be the one
to catch you.

1054
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,755
LUPlN:
Severus-

1055
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:19,677
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1056
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,178
Brilliant, Snape.

1057
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:25,724
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1058
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,602
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and l have business...

1059
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:33,774
- ...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1060
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,527
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1061
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,320
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1062
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:40,906
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1063
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:43,617
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1064
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,662
I could do it, you know.

1065
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:52,751
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1066
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:55,629
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1067
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:59,300
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1068
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:04,888
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but l'll do my best.

1069
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,349
LUPlN:
Severus, please.

1070
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:10,394
After you.

1071
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,567
Expelliarmus!

1072
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,905
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1073
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:24,700
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1074
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,535
We thought he was our friend!

1075
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,705
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1076
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:33,083
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1077
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:36,086
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1078
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:40,257
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1079
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:45,304
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1080
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:48,724
- Scabbers has been in my family for-
- Twelve years?

1081
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,393
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1082
01:34:51,561 --> 01:34:54,146
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
So what?

1083
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:57,274
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his-
Finger!

1084
01:34:57,484 --> 01:35:00,736
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1085
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,947
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1086
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,620
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1087
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:10,871
Scabbers!

1088
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,124
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1089
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,009
Ah!

1090
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:38,440
Remus?

1091
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,692
Sirius.

1092
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,778
My old friends!

1093
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,246
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1094
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:56,083
- James. We were the best of friends-
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1095
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,545
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1096
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:04,967
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- l didn't mean to!

1097
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:07,970
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1098
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,806
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1099
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:16,770
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1100
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,316
PETTlGREW: James wouldn't have
wanted me killed!

1101
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:27,197
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1102
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:31,869
 Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1103
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,121
No!

1104
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:39,585
- Harry, this man-
- l know what he is.

1105
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,670
But we'll take him to the castle.

1106
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:46,884
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1107
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,429
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1108
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,015
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1109
01:36:56,936 --> 01:37:00,689
 Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1110
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:04,401
 A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1111
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,111
I was going for the rat.

1112
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:10,115
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1113
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:15,537
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1114
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:20,584
The tail l could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1115
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,468
Okay.

1116
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:34,640
Okay.

1117
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,189
 You better go.
No. Don't worry, okay?

1118
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,774
It's fine. I'll stay.

1119
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:46,527
You go, l'll stay.

1120
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,947
 You okay?
- l'm fine. Go.

1121
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,535
HERMlONE: That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1122
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,287
They might chop it.

1123
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:00,415
HERMlONE: l'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1124
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:04,795
 lt's too late. lt's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1125
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,881
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1126
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:12,469
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1127
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:16,348
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1128
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:21,311
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1129
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,273
He doesn't deserve it.

1130
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,109
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1131
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:28,819
...to become killers.

1132
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:33,198
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1133
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:35,742
Alive, you're free.

1134
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,996
PETTlGREW: Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1135
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:42,541
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1136
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:45,210
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1137
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:49,423
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't-
LUPlN: Get away from her!

1138
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,802
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1139
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:58,056
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1140
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,183
I know.

1141
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:05,397
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1142
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:08,066
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1143
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:10,736
What? Come and live with you?

1144
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,198
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1145
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,950
HERMlONE:
Harry!

1146
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:35,886
 Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1147
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,726
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1148
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:46,063
This flesh is only flesh!

1149
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,316
Expelliarmus!

1150
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,952
Harry!

1151
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:04,998
Remus! Remus!

1152
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,548
Run! Run!

1153
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:25,602
 Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1154
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:30,857
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1155
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,276
Professor?

1156
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,907
Professor Lupin?

1157
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:49,918
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1158
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:52,879
There you are, Potter!

1159
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:27,706
Sirius!

1160
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,959
Come back here, Potter!

1161
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,193
Sirius!

1162
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,947
No. Sirius!

1163
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:26,700
Expecto Patronum!

1164
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,876
HERMlONE:
Harry?

1165
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,171
I saw my dad.

1166
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:46,923
HERMlONE:
What?

1167
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,675
He sent the dementors away.

1168
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,260
I saw him across the lake.

1169
01:45:50,428 --> 01:45:52,095
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1170
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:55,140
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1171
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:57,809
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1172
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,853
Much worse.

1173
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,397
They're going to suck out his soul.

1174
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,483
Headmaster, stop them.

1175
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:09,029
- They've got the wrong man.
- lt's true. Sirius is innocent.

1176
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,406
- lt's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1177
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:12,949
He's my rat, sir.

1178
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:17,162
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1179
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:21,041
- But then they gave him an owl-
- The point is, we know the truth.

1180
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,752
- Please believe us.
- l do, Miss Granger.

1181
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:29,382
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1182
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:35,263
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1183
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:39,184
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1184
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,941
Mysterious thing, time.

1185
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,444
Powerful...

1186
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,489
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1187
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:57,702
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell
of the Dark Tower.

1188
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,622
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1189
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,582
You must not be seen.

1190
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:06,419
And you would do well, l feel,
to return before this last chime.

1191
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:10,131
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1192
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,467
If you succeed tonight...

1193
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:15,470
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1194
01:47:17,306 --> 01:47:19,516
Three turns should do it, I think.

1195
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:26,231
Oh, and by the way.

1196
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:32,237
When in doubt, l find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1197
01:47:32,404 --> 01:47:34,489
Good luck.

1198
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:37,450
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1199
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,453
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1200
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:11,067
What just happened?

1201
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:13,528
- Where's Ron?
HERMlONE: 7:30.

1202
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,572
Where were we at 7:30?

1203
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,532
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1204
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,076
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1205
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:22,996
Hermione!

1206
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:43,850
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1207
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:47,854
Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1208
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,272
Come to see the show?

1209
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,275
HERMlONE: You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1210
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:53,776
That's us.

1211
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,905
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1212
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:58,573
This is not normal.

1213
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:03,244
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1214
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:05,622
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1215
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:09,125
This is how l've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1216
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:12,545
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1217
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:16,090
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1218
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,554
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1219
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:26,017
Good punch.

1220
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:27,685
Thanks.

1221
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:30,355
Malfoy's coming.

1222
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,608
 Run.
Not a word to anyone.

1223
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:37,153
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1224
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:41,241
HERMlONE: That felt good.
Not good, brilliant.

1225
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:45,203
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1226
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,891
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1227
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:10,228
Of course.

1228
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,397
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1229
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:16,609
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1230
01:50:16,986 --> 01:50:18,319
Let's go.

1231
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:41,718
Here they come. l'd better hurry.

1232
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,387
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1233
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:47,015
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1234
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,435
Scabbers, you're alive!

1235
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,396
 Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1236
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:56,524
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1237
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:59,694
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1238
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:06,284
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1239
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:09,287
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1240
01:51:09,455 --> 01:51:12,332
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1241
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,375
We can't be seen.

1242
01:51:18,047 --> 01:51:19,756
Fudge is coming.

1243
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,759
And we aren't leaving?

1244
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,512
Why aren't we leaving?

1245
01:51:37,441 --> 01:51:38,983
Are you mad?

1246
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:43,696
Ow!

1247
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:46,366
Ow. That hurt.

1248
01:51:46,575 --> 01:51:47,909
Sorry.

1249
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:04,842
 That's ling
you see there- Ah, Hagrid.

1250
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:11,432
HERMlONE:
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1251
01:52:28,826 --> 01:52:31,327
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1252
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:35,039
What?

1253
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,750
HERMlONE:
I thought I just saw...

1254
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,628
- Never mind.
Let's go.

1255
01:52:54,935 --> 01:52:57,228
HERMlONE:
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1256
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:05,445
Get away. Get off.

1257
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:23,629
Ow!

1258
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:31,053
 Minister, l really think
I should sign as well.

1259
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:35,057
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1260
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:39,061
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1261
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:46,235
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1262
01:53:48,614 --> 01:53:52,408
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1263
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:56,537
 Your name only.
It's a very long name...

1264
01:53:56,914 --> 01:53:58,623
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1265
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:04,295
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1266
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:06,797
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1267
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:13,930
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
Here, minister. Follow me.

1268
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:15,806
- Now, look there.
Where?

1269
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:19,393
 Look beyond the rocks.
What am l supposed to see?

1270
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:23,064
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1271
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:26,067
- Oh, yes. lndeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1272
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:29,654
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
l see no strawberries.

1273
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,239
 There.
Where?

1274
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:33,157
 There.
This way.

1275
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:36,035
 Let's get this over, please.
All right.

1276
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:39,413
But where is it?

1277
01:54:40,332 --> 01:54:42,542
I saw the beast, just now.

1278
01:54:43,168 --> 01:54:45,378
- Not a moment ago!
How extraordinary.

1279
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:46,879
Buckbeak.

1280
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:51,175
 Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1281
01:54:51,343 --> 01:54:52,677
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1282
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:57,139
 I don't think he suggests
you had anything to do with this.

1283
01:54:57,349 --> 01:55:00,184
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1284
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,228
 Right.
- Well, well.

1285
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:03,938
We must search the grounds.

1286
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:07,149
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1287
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:12,738
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1288
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:16,909
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1289
01:55:17,077 --> 01:55:18,953
Thank you.

1290
01:55:19,162 --> 01:55:22,456
 You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1291
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:34,719
HERMlONE: Come on.
This way.

1292
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:43,311
This way, now.

1293
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:47,481
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1294
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:50,192
 How?
- No idea.

1295
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:01,871
- Look. It's Lupin.
lmmobulus!

1296
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:10,296
HERMlONE:
And Snape's coming.

1297
01:56:16,511 --> 01:56:21,182
And now we wait.

1298
01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:44,497
Ah!

1299
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:50,795
HERMlONE:
At least someone's enjoying himself.

1300
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,004
Yeah.

1301
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,592
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1302
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:01,097
Before, down by the lake,
when l was with Sirius...

1303
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:03,391
...l did see someone.

1304
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:06,977
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1305
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:08,479
With a Patronus.

1306
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,564
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1307
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,191
According to him...

1308
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:15,778
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1309
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,822
It was my dad.

1310
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:20,741
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1311
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:23,160
- Harry, but your dad's-
- Dead. l know.

1312
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:26,914
I'm just telling you what l saw.

1313
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:32,670
Here we come.

1314
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:40,720
 You see Sirius talking to me?
HERMlONE: Uh-huh.

1315
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:43,723
 He's asking me to live with him.
- That's great.

1316
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,226
When we free him, l'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1317
01:57:47,394 --> 01:57:49,019
It'll just be me and him.

1318
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,647
We could live in the country...

1319
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:54,442
...someplace you can see the sky.

1320
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,445
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1321
01:57:58,488 --> 01:57:59,780
HERMlONE:
Harry!

1322
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:03,284
Run!

1323
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:11,709
Let's go.

1324
01:58:31,271 --> 01:58:33,606
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1325
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:39,236
Thanks.

1326
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:45,117
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1327
02:00:00,235 --> 02:00:01,986
HERMlONE:
That was so scary.

1328
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:05,114
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1329
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:19,670
Sirius. Come on!

1330
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:37,813
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1331
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:41,191
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1332
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:51,744
Any minute now.

1333
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,996
Right there. You'll see.

1334
02:00:55,373 --> 02:00:57,875
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1335
02:00:58,043 --> 02:01:00,586
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1336
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:07,176
 Sirius.
HERMlONE: You're dying...

1337
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,096
...both of you.

1338
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,892
Harry!

1339
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:20,689
Expecto Patronum!

1340
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:20,874
You were right, Hermione.

1341
02:02:21,042 --> 02:02:24,378
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1342
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:27,297
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1343
02:02:27,465 --> 02:02:29,842
I knew l could do it
this time because...

1344
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,719
...well, l had already done it.

1345
02:02:31,886 --> 02:02:34,346
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1346
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:35,764
But l don't like flying...!

1347
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:51,822
Bombarda!

1348
02:03:25,148 --> 02:03:27,941
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1349
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:29,443
...to both of you.

1350
02:03:29,611 --> 02:03:32,529
- l want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1351
02:03:32,697 --> 02:03:35,616
For some time,
my life will be too unpredictable.

1352
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:37,534
And besides...

1353
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:41,747
- ...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1354
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:44,041
And you know it.

1355
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:47,002
And for now, that will do.

1356
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:51,882
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1357
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:55,427
...but you look so like your father.

1358
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:59,139
Except your eyes.

1359
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,392
- You have-
- My mother's eyes.

1360
02:04:04,354 --> 02:04:09,441
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1361
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:11,527
But know this:

1362
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:15,823
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1363
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,159
And you can always find them...

1364
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:23,413
...in here.

1365
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,343
You really are the brightest witch
of your age.

1366
02:05:03,163 --> 02:05:04,788
We have to go.

1367
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:35,736
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1368
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:37,446
Did what?

1369
02:05:37,614 --> 02:05:39,573
Good night.

1370
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:49,666
How did you get there?

1371
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:52,502
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1372
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:55,464
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- l don't know.

1373
02:05:55,632 --> 02:05:59,176
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1374
02:06:25,662 --> 02:06:27,162
LUPlN:
Hello, Harry.

1375
02:06:30,792 --> 02:06:32,626
LUPlN:
I saw you coming.

1376
02:06:37,173 --> 02:06:39,883
I've looked worse, believe me.

1377
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:45,764
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1378
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:48,892
No. I resigned, actually.

1379
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,852
Resigned? Why?

1380
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:56,316
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1381
02:06:56,484 --> 02:07:01,989
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1382
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:05,534
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1383
02:07:05,743 --> 02:07:07,661
- But Dumbledore-
- He has already...

1384
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:09,705
...risked enough on my behalf.

1385
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:13,125
Besides, people like me are...

1386
02:07:13,751 --> 02:07:17,087
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1387
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,224
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1388
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:31,560
None of it made any difference.

1389
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:35,272
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1390
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,942
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1391
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:41,611
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1392
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:44,489
It made a great deal of difference.

1393
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,330
If l am proud of anything...

1394
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:54,166
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1395
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:57,085
Now, since l am no longer
your teacher...

1396
02:07:57,253 --> 02:08:01,506
...l feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1397
02:08:02,425 --> 02:08:04,926
So now l'll say goodbye, Harry.

1398
02:08:05,094 --> 02:08:07,679
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1399
02:08:08,222 --> 02:08:09,556
Until then...

1400
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,601
...mischief managed.

1401
02:08:46,844 --> 02:08:51,056
 Stand back, I said! Or l'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1402
02:08:51,224 --> 02:08:52,641
Harry.

1403
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:54,851
Wherever did you get it?

1404
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:57,437
Can l have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1405
02:08:57,605 --> 02:08:59,773
 What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1406
02:08:59,941 --> 02:09:03,235
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1407
02:09:03,403 --> 02:09:05,904
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1408
02:09:06,072 --> 02:09:07,572
Did not.

1409
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:12,452
 lt's a Firebolt.
It's the fastest broom in the world.

1410
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:14,162
For me?

1411
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:16,873
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1412
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:18,959
This came with it.

1413
02:09:23,798 --> 02:09:25,465
 Go!
Let's see.

1414
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:27,467
HERMlONE:
How fast is it, Harry?

1415
02:09:47,447 --> 02:09:48,447
Lumos.

1416
02:09:48,614 --> 02:09:51,032
l solemnly swear that l am
up to no good.

1417
02:21:10,212 --> 02:21:12,004
Mischief managed.

1418
02:21:17,761 --> 02:21:19,220
Nox.
